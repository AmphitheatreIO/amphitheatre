# Amphitheatre Server

Amphitheatre is an open source developer platform that facilitates continuous
development of applications and microservices. You can iterate your application
source code locally, then deploy to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster, just
like docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose up. Amphitheatre handles
the workflow of building, pushing, and deploying applications. It also provides
building blocks and describes customization of CI/CD pipelines. It is written in
Rust, with the Axum framework.
